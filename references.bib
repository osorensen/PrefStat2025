  abstract = {Commonly we hear sound without experiencing the associated visual activity to tell us how the sounds were made or from where they originate. In the larger context of electroacoustic music, and more specifically in acousmatic music where causal visual information is removed, it is interesting to investigate how a sense of human agency may be evoked by sound alone. An intuitive starting point would be to assume that the listener identifies source and cause through a sound's close proximity to a known archetype, yet composers often work with materials offering less obvious source clues, while expanding the spatial image over many loudspeakers. New technologies allow us to accurately control the movement of sound in space, and because we understand our own bodies in spatial terms, it is natural to ask how a sound's spatial behaviour influences our listening understanding. This paper investigates two research questions: can listeners identify human agency in 3-D sound, and if so, what are the most salient features involved in this process? Besides being of interest to electroacoustic composers, the topic is also relevant to the audio industry utilising high density loudspeaker arrays in cinema and other spaces where the projection of high resolution spatial imagery is possible.},

  abstract = {We are interested in learning how listeners perceive sounds as having human origins. An experiment was performed with a series of electronically synthesized sounds, and listeners were asked to compare them in pairs. We propose a Bayesian probabilistic method to learn individual preferences from nontransitive pairwise comparison data, as happens when one (or more) individual preferences in the data contradicts what is implied by the others. We build a Bayesian Mallows model in order to handle nontransitive data, with a latent layer of uncertainty which captures the generation of preference misreporting. We then develop a mixture extension of the Mallows model, able to learn individual preferences in a heterogeneous population. The results of our analysis of the musicology experiment are of interest to electroacoustic composers and sound designers, and to the audio industry in general, whose aim is to understand how computer generated sounds can be produced in order to sound more human.}

  abstract = {The Mallows model (MM) occupies a central role in parametric modelling of ranking data to learn preferences of a population of judges. Despite the wide range of metrics for rankings that can be considered in the model specification, the choice is typically limited to the Kendall, Cayley or Hamming distances, due to the closed-form expression of the related model normalizing constant. This work instead focuses on the Mallows model with Spearman distance (MMS). A novel approximation of the normalizing constant is introduced to allow inference even with a large number of items. This allows us to develop and implement an efficient and accurate EM algorithm for estimating finite mixtures of MMS aimed at i) enlarging the applicability to samples drawn from heterogeneous populations, and ii) dealing with partial rankings affected by diverse forms of censoring. These novelties encompass the critical inferential steps that traditionally limited the use of this distance in practice, and render the MMS comparable (or even preferable) to the MMs with other metrics in terms of computational burden. The inferential ability of the EM scheme and the effectiveness of the approximation are assessed by extensive simulation studies. Finally, we show that the application to three real-world datasets endorses our proposals also in the comparison with competing mixtures of ranking models.},

  abstract = {Ranking and comparing items is crucial for collecting information about preferences in many areas, from marketing to politics. The Mallows rank model is among the most successful approaches to analyze rank data, but its computational complexity has limited its use to a particular form based on Kendall distance. We develop new computationally tractable methods for Bayesian inference in Mallows models that work with any right-invariant distance. Our method performs inference on the consensus ranking of the items, also when based on partial rankings, such as top-k items or pairwise comparisons. We prove that items that none of the assessors has ranked do not inuence the maximum a posteriori consensus ranking, and can therefore be ignored. When assessors are many or heterogeneous, we propose a mixture model for clustering them in homogeneous subgroups, with cluster-specific consensus rankings. We develop approximate stochastic algorithms that allow a fully probabilistic analysis, leading to coherent quantifications of uncertainties. We make probabilistic predictions on the class membership of assessors based on their ranking of just some items, and predict missing individual preferences, as needed in recommendation systems. We test our approach using several experimental and benchmark data sets.},
